Bitbake Setup for PinIx

Using Shared State Cache at pine64.my-ho.st to speed up builds on x86_64

By Default, this will create binaries/images for the Star64/PineTabv Device. To build for different platforms, please use MACHINE="<machinename>" bitbake <command>

Machines Supported:
* star64
* pinetabv

You can now build. Some sample images:

* star64-image-minimal
* star64-image-weston
* star64-image-plasma
* pinetabv-image-plasma (with MACHINE=pinetabv)

Start a build with:

`bitbake <imagename>` or `bitbake <package>` or `MACHINE=pinetabv bitbake <image/package>`
