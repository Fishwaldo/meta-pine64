Bitbake Setup for PinIx

Using Shared State Cache at pine64.my-ho.st to speed up builds on x86_64

By Default, this will create binaries/images for the Star64 Device. To build for different platforms, please use MACHINE="<machinename>" bitbake <command>

You can now build. Some sample images:

* star64-image-minimal
* star64-image-weston
* star64-image-plasma

Start a build with:

`bitbake <imagename>` or `bitbake <package>`
